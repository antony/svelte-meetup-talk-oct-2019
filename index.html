# Svelte Most Wanted
## October, 2019

---

class: .center.middle

# Agenda

1. Authentication with Sapper
1. Asynchronous Library Loading
1. Configuration
1. SCSS
1. Validation

---

class: center, middle, title-slide

# Who am I?

???

1. My name is Antony Jones
1. Co-Founder of Beyonk - adventure, travel, leisure - (we're hiring!)
1. Been using Svelte since v1
1. Saw the opportunity to build really light widgets to drop into partner sites
1. Founding Beyonk gave me the opportunity to put what I believed into practice
1. I used to be a backend Java developer. Svelte is one of the only reasons I tolerate the front-end.

---

class: center, middle, title-slide, alternative

# Why this talk?

???

* I work from home most of the time
* I always have discord open in a tab
* The same questions come up over and over
* I have gists
* I thought it might be nice to talk through these things
* It's important to understand that "missing things" are often "intentional decisions"

---

# #1 Authentication with Sapper

---

class: center, middle, quote

<blockquote>
  <p>There are two hard problems in computer science: Cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors.</p>
  <footer>
  -- <cite>Leon Bambrick</cite>
  </footer>
</blockquote>

---

## The Problem:

Sapper kindly gives us some more hard problems:

1. SSR
1. Not-SSR

???
Can't export application with Auth. Routes are pre-prendered.
Everybody would get the same content.
How do you get authentication on the server-side? And on the client-side?

---

## The Solution:

1. JWT
1. httpOnly cookies
1. Express cookie-parser
1. JsonWebToken

???
JWT creation done in API, Hapi - Hapi-Auth-JWT-2, Jsonwebtoken
JWT is encoded and signed, can be decoded but not verified in browser
We can use data from the JWT to display to the user
Express Cookie Parser works with Polka - they have the same API
Cookies - Widely Supported, Get passed on every request
HttpOnly cookies for security - browser cannot see, only pass

---

### Authentication flow

<div class="mermaid">
  sequenceDiagram
    participant Browser
    participant Server
    participant API

    rect rgba(0, 0, 255, .1)
    Browser->>API: Login Request
    API-->>Browser: setCookie(JWT)
    end

    rect rgba(0, 255, 0, .1)
    Browser->>API: fetch({ credentials: true })
    Note right of Browser: Sends JWT
    end

    rect rgba(255, 0, 0, .1)
    Browser->>Server: goto('/page')
    Note over Server: preload ()
    Server->>API: this.fetch({ credentials: true })
    end
</div>

???

* API sends a Json Web Token to the Browser as a Cookie
* Browser stores Cookie

* Fetch with credentials passes cookie to API
* API verifies JWT integrity and authenticate user

* Browser triggers server to preload
* Preload has `this.fetch` which has cookie access

---

### The server-side

<div data-code-highlight data-locs='[
  { "line": 2 },
  { "line": 4, "length": 2 },
  { "line": 7 },
  { "line": 9 }
]'>
  polka()
    .use(
      cookieParser(),
      (req, res, next) => {
        const token = req.cookies['my-jwt-name']
        const profile = token ? jwt.decode(token) : false
  
        return sapper.middleware({
          session: (req) => {
            return { authenticated: !!profile, profile }
          }
        })(req, res, next)
      }
    )
</div>


---

### The client-side

<div data-code-highlight data-locs='[
  { "line": 5, "length": 2 },
  { "line": 0 },
  { "line": 1 }
]'>
  {#if $session.authenticated}
  <h1>Hello {$session.profile.name}</h1>
  {/if}

  <script>
    import stores from 'svelte/stores'
    const { session } = stores()
  </script>
</div>

???
Works on the server-side and the client-side.

---

### Fetching authenticated data

<div data-code-highlight data-locs='[
  { "line": 3, "length": 3 },
  { "line": 4 },
  { "line": 0 }
]'>
  <h1>Your secret: {secret}</h1>

  <script>
    const { secret } = await fetch('/some/endpoint', {
      credentials: true
    })
  </script>
</div>

???
1. Simple destructuring of some JSON from /some/endpoint
1. Credentials: true - pass cookies to the API
1. Use the returned data
Can use the same technique in "preload" using `this.fetch`.

---

# #2 Loading third-party libraries.

???

* Sometimes business forces us into things we don't want to do
* Facebook customer chat
* Google Analytics
* Google Maps
* Facebook customer chat - again
* Third parties will kill your lighthouse score

---

## The Problem:

1. When is a library "loaded"?
1. When is Svelte "ready"?
1. When is the DOM "ready"?
1. What if my components are destroyed?

???

1. Does the library provide a callback?
1. When can I guarantee that Svelte has finished setting up my page?
1. Library attaches to a DOM element, then the DOM element is removed.
1. The removed DOM element is put back, but the library doesn't know.
1. All SPAs suffer from a similar problem.
1. Often a library loaded twice can cause significant problems
1. Google SDK worst offender - pulls out the script tag, replaces it with 7 more. If you keep installing in an SPA, these tags pile up.

---

## The Solution:

<div data-code-highlight data-locs='[
  { "line": 0 },
  { "line": 1, "length": 3 },
  { "line": 5 },
  { "line": 6 },
  { "line": 7 },
  { "line": 8 }
]'>
export default function (url, test, callback) {
  if (test()) {
    return callback()
  }

  const tag = document.createElement('script')
  tag.src = url
  tag.onload = callback
  document.body.appendChild(tag)
}
</div>

???

1. Simple but effective.
1. First, test that it isn't already loaded - existence of global var, callback sets value, dom element exists, or existence of script tag
1. If it's loaded, call the initialisation code (this should be idempotent)
1. If it's not, inject a script tag into the page.

# #3 Configuration

???

1. This is a large topic
1. Describing `process.env` and how it works in a bundled application.

---

## The Problem:

process.env contains environment variables pertaining to the runtime environment. In a browser, though, it doesn't exist. How do we get hold of environment varibles in a user's browser?

???

* On the server side, `process.env.NODE_ENV` might equal `production`
* On the client side, `process.env` is an null, and `process.env.NODE_ENV` throws an error.

---

class: center, middle

# The Solution:

[![NPM](https://nodeico.herokuapp.com/rollup-plugin-replace.svg)](https://npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-replace)

---

<div data-code-highlight data-locs='[
  { "line": 0 },
  { "line": 2, "length": 4 },
  { "line": 7 },
  { "line": 8, "length": 2 },
  { "line": 15, "length": 3 }
]'>
import replace from 'rollup-plugin-replace'

const conf = {
  apiKey: 'some-value',
  otherValue: 'other-value'
}

const appConfig = Object.keys(conf).reduce((acc, n) => {
	acc[`process.env.${n}`] = JSON.stringify(conf[n])
	return acc
}, {})

export default {
  ...,
	plugins: [
    replace({
      ...appConfig
    }),
    ...
  ]
}
</div>

???

* Or Yarn. Lol.
* Or Webpack. Alias - does anybody know the name?
* Stringify is really important
* Creates a replacement token `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME` to reduce cognitive overhead
* You can't destructure - why?

---

# A Caveat:

You can't do this!

```
process.env.MY_VARIABLE = 'foo'
const { MY_VARIABLE } = process.env
```

--

Results in an error 'Cannot get property env of undefined'

???

* At runtime, looks for `process`. Doesn't exist in a browser.

--

You can do this:

```
process.env.MY_VARIABLE = 'foo'
const MY_VARIABLE = process.env.MY_VARIABLE
```

--

Why?

```
const MY_VARIABLE = 'foo'

// if (process.env.MY_VARIABLE === 'foo')
if ('foo' === 'foo') {
  // stuff
}
```

???

* The alias plugin literally replaces strings whilst bundling.
* Because it looks for exact strings like `process.env.MY_VARIABLE`, you can't destructure.
* Silly things like `true === true`.

---

class: center, middle, title-slide

# #4 SCSS
# #4 Stylus
# #4 Global Styling
# #4 PostCSS

???

1. This slide has "at least" four titles
1. Will be explained later

## The Problem:

> We *can't adopt* Svelte until it supports Framework X, React supports this *out-of-the-box*, how can you expect *to-compete*? This isn't a *serious framework*...

<footer>
  -- <cite>The People</cite>
</footer>

???
* Amalgamation of things I've seen
* Not a serious framework
* Being Opinionated or not defines you as serious.
* Dangerous coupling
* Please build-in and bless (which? SCSS? Stylus, Less, Css In Js? Flavour of the Day?)

---

class: center, middle

## The Solution:

[![NPM](https://nodeico.herokuapp.com/svelte-preprocess.svg)](https://npmjs.com/package/svelte-preprocess)

???

* Module by Kaisermann
* Support for numerous preprocessors
* Easy to configure
* Great documentation
* People get distracted by `-scss` or `-stylus` equivalents.
* Must also install `sass` or `stylus` modules etc

---

### In your Rollup config:

<div data-code-highlight data-locs='[
  { "line": 0 },
  { "line": 1 },
  { "line": 2 },
  { "line": 3, "length": 6 },
  { "line": 9, "length": 5 }
]'>
svelte({
  preprocess: sveltePreprocess({
    transformers: {
      scss: {
        includePaths: [
          'node_modules',
          'src'
        ]
      },
      postcss: {
        plugins: [
          require('autoprefixer')
        ]
      }
    }
  })
})
</div>

???

* Svelte does actually support preprocessors
* Works without configuration, but
* includePaths saves a lot of relative paths `../..`
* Autoprefixer so nasty "browsers" like Safari and Edge can render pages

---

### In your layout:

TODO: Check this is the way to do it.
<div data-code-highlight data-locs='[
  { "line": 1 }
]'>
<svelte:head>
  <script src="path/to/your/scss-entrypoint.scss"></script>
</svelte:head>
</div>

In your components:

<div data-code-highlight data-locs='[
  { "line": 1 },
  { "line": 4 }
]'>
<script lang="scss">
  @import 'path/to/your/variables.scss';

  div {
    color: $mainColour;
  }
</script>
</div>

???

* Use lang scss in your script tags
* Import in layout, css is global, not scoped.
* In components, import variables.

---

### Bonus Feature

<div data-code-highlight data-locs='[
  { "line": 0 }
]'>
<script global>
  .button {
    colour: blue;
  }
</script>
</div>

???

* A newer feature of svelte-preprocess
* Automatically prefixes your styles with global
* Treat it like you'd treat !important. Scoped CSS is the future.

# #5 Validation

???

* Reactive variables and directives make validation quite easy.
* This is my take on validation. It's not a solution for everyone.
* Valiation is an unsolved problem, and is very subjective.
* Users still won't get it. No matter how hard you try.

---

class: image-slide

## The Problem:

![DeviantART Validation](/static/images/deviantart-errors.png)

???

* hard to get right
* Long forms - scroll to top for messages? brittle?
* Focus error fields?
* Where do you show messages?
* Multiple validation messages per field? Or Bail Early?
* Does colouration of a field make it better?
* Do people understand symbols? (X means clear as well as WRONG)
* Validate everything on submit? What if submit is disabled?

---

## The Solution:

* I don't have a solution!
* But I can do the best I can, and learn from my users.

--

### Goals:

* I want something reusable
* I want something pretty obvious
* I don't want boilerplate
* I want delegation
* I want a lifecycle

???

* Creating a feedback loop is critical
* Creating a fast feedback loop is optimal
* Delegation - I don't want to worry about a field, I want to validate a form
* When I validate a form, I want each field to handle itself
* I want my CTA to be part of the validation lifecycle.

---

## The Solution

<iframe style="height: 60%; width: 96%;" src="https://svelte.dev/repl/54d159b954d9412c8247807125d9fe1b?version=3.12.1">
</iframe>

???

* Three Parts
* The validator directive (Thanks @pngwn)
* The individual fields share validation 
* The validation is obvious - colours, hints
* $valid - reactive, I always know if a field is valid or not.
* $dirty - don't show validation messages if I haven't done anything (thanks angular)

---

### Validation Stores

<div data-code-highlight data-locs='[
    { "line": 0 },
    { "line": 1, "length": 4 },
    { "line": 6, "length": 4 }
  ]'>
import createValidator from './validate.js'
import {
  emailValidator,
  requiredValidator
} from './validators.js'

const [
  emailValidity,
  validateEmailField
] = createValidator(requiredValidator(), emailValidator())

let email = null
</div>

???

* Validators, simple function which return true or an error messages
* `createValidator` is an action factory
* `createValidator` returns a tuple:
  * emailValidity = validity store, dirty and valid
  * validateEmailField = an action, add to field with `use:`

---

### Validators

<div data-code-highlight data-locs='[
  { "line": 0 },
  { "line": 1 },
  { "line": 2, "length": 2 }
]'>
function minLengthValidator (length) {
  return function minLength (value) {
    const meetsRequirements = value && value.length >= length
    return meetsRequirements || `Must be at least ${length} characters`
  }
}
</div>

???

* Function which returns a function - currying
* Outer function takes customisable parameters
* Returned function takes value as parameter
* Pass a series of curried functions to the validation action

---

### Validation Action Factory

<div data-code-highlight data-locs='[
  { "line": 3 },
  { "line": 5, "length": 14 },
  { "line": 12 },
  { "line": 20 }
]'>
import { writable } from 'svelte/store'

export default function (...validators) {
  const { subscribe, set } = writable({ dirty: false, valid: false, message: null })

  function action (node) {
    function validate (dirty = true) {
      const failing = validators.find(v => v(node.value) !== true)

      set({ dirty, valid: !failing, message: failing && failing(node.value) })
    }

    node.addEventListener('input', validate)
    validate(false)

    return {
      destroy: () => node.removeEventListener('input', validate)
    }
  }

  return [ { subscribe }, action ]
}
</div>

???

* At first glance, seems like a lot of code
* Due to Svelte's reactivity, simple, reactive validation can be a single line of code
* All the validation code you will ever need throughout your app
* Very DRY

* Factory creates a writable store and pulls off it's subscribe and set methods
* Create the action, to be used on the input field
* Add an event listener when the input changes
* Return a thing which looks like a store (reactive), can be subscribed to
* Return the action we created just above
